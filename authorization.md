# Authorization

Trax supports three levels of authorization for the API layer:

- **Endpoint-level**: gate all Trax endpoints behind a single policy using the `configure` callback on `UseTraxGraphQL`. This is standard ASP.NET Core endpoint authorization.
- **Per-train**: restrict individual trains using the `[TraxAuthorize]` attribute on the train class. When a request comes in to run or queue a train, Trax checks the attribute against the current HTTP user before executing anything.
- **Per-model**: restrict `[TraxQueryModel]`-exposed entities using the same `[TraxAuthorize]` attribute on the entity class. The directive is enforced at GraphQL type level, so the gate also applies when the entity is reached transitively through a navigation property on an ungated parent.

A surface exposed via GraphQL can also be explicitly opened to anonymous access with `[TraxAllowAnonymous]`. See [Anonymous Access via TraxAllowAnonymous](#anonymous-access-via-traxallowanonymous) below.

Endpoint-level auth answers "can this user reach the Trax API at all?" Per-train auth answers "can this user execute *this particular* train?" Per-model auth answers "can this user read rows of *this particular* type, regardless of how they navigated to it?"

## Required Exposure Posture

Every surface exposed via GraphQL must state its authorization posture explicitly. A `[TraxQuery]`/`[TraxMutation]` train or a `[TraxQueryModel]` entity must declare **either** `[TraxAuthorize]` (gated) **or** `[TraxAllowAnonymous]` (intentionally public). A surface that declares neither fails at host startup, so a forgotten gate can never silently ship as a public endpoint. The check runs in `AddTraxGraphQL` (trains) and `TraxGraphQLBuilder.Build()` (query models); the failure message names every offending type.

The one relaxation is endpoint-level gating: `RequireAuthorization()` on the GraphQL builder covers every surface at the transport layer, so a per-surface marker is no longer required. Because nothing is reachable anonymously under that gate, `[TraxAllowAnonymous]` becomes a contradiction there and is rejected.

| Endpoint posture | neither marker | `[TraxAuthorize]` | `[TraxAllowAnonymous]` | both |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Open (default) | fails startup (implicitly public) | gated | intentionally public | fails startup (conflict) |
| Gated (`RequireAuthorization()`) | allowed (gate covers it) | allowed (adds finer policy/role) | fails startup (contradiction) | fails startup (conflict) |

`RequireAuthorization()` and `[TraxAuthorize]` are not redundant: the endpoint gate is a single transport-level check ("must be authenticated / satisfy this one policy"), while `[TraxAuthorize]` adds per-surface policy and role requirements on top. They compose as defense in depth.

This rule applies only to surfaces that are actually exposed via GraphQL. A train with no `[TraxQuery]`/`[TraxMutation]` (run only through the scheduler, a remote worker, or `ITrainBus` directly) is never reachable over GraphQL and needs no marker.

## Per-Train Authorization

Decorate any train class with `[TraxAuthorize]` to declare authorization requirements:

```csharp
using Trax.Effect.Attributes;

// Requires an authenticated user. No specific policy or role.
[TraxAuthorize]
public class WhoAmITrain : ServiceTrain<Unit, UserInfo>, IWhoAmITrain
{
    protected override Task<Either<Exception, UserInfo>> Junctions() =>
        Chain<ReadUserJunction>().Resolve();
}

// Requires the "Admin" authorization policy
[TraxAuthorize("Admin")]
public class DeleteUserTrain : ServiceTrain<DeleteUserInput, Unit>, IDeleteUserTrain
{
    protected override Unit Junctions() => Chain<DeleteUserJunction>();
}

// Requires the user to have at least one of the listed roles
[TraxAuthorize(Roles = "Manager,Admin")]
public class GenerateReportTrain : ServiceTrain<ReportInput, ReportOutput>, IGenerateReportTrain
{
    protected override ReportOutput Junctions() => Chain<GenerateReportJunction>();
}

// No attribute, no per-train auth check. Valid only because this train is not
// exposed via GraphQL (no [TraxQuery]/[TraxMutation]). A GraphQL-exposed train
// with no marker fails startup — see Required Exposure Posture above.
public class PingTrain : ServiceTrain<PingInput, PongOutput>, IPingTrain
{
    protected override PongOutput Junctions() => Chain<PingJunction>();
}
```

The attribute supports two properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `Policy` | `string?` | Name of an ASP.NET Core authorization policy to evaluate |
| `Roles` | `string?` | Comma-separated list of roles. The user must have at least one. Role comparison is case-insensitive. |

The attribute works on classes, interfaces, and base classes. Trax unions the attributes it finds across the implementation type's interface chain and base chain, so `[TraxAuthorize("Admin")]` on an `IMyTrain` interface is honored even when the implementing class carries no attribute. Decorator-wrapped trains inherit their authorization requirements through the same mechanism.

Role comparison is case-insensitive. `[TraxAuthorize(Roles = "admin")]` matches a principal carrying `ClaimTypes.Role = "Admin"` and vice-versa - both sides are normalized to upper-invariant.

## How Policies and Roles Combine

Multiple attributes and mixed policy/role specifications combine as follows:

| Attribute form | What the user must satisfy |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| `[TraxAuthorize]` (bare) | Be authenticated. No additional policy or role requirement. |
| `[TraxAuthorize("P")]` | Policy `P` must pass. |
| `[TraxAuthorize(Roles = "A,B")]` | Hold role `A` OR role `B`. |
| `[TraxAuthorize("P", Roles = "A")]` | Policy `P` must pass AND hold role `A`. |
| `[TraxAuthorize("P1")] [TraxAuthorize("P2")]` | Both `P1` and `P2` must pass. Policies AND across attributes. |
| `[TraxAuthorize(Roles = "A")] [TraxAuthorize(Roles = "B")]` | Hold role `A` OR role `B`. Roles union OR across attributes. |
| `[TraxAuthorize("P")] [TraxAuthorize(Roles = "A")]` | Policy `P` must pass AND hold role `A`. |

In short: every policy has to pass, and at least one role from the unioned list has to match. A bare attribute requires nothing beyond authentication.

```csharp
[TraxAuthorize("MustBeInternal")]
[TraxAuthorize(Roles = "Admin,Manager")]
public class SensitiveTrain : ServiceTrain<SensitiveInput, Unit>, ISensitiveTrain { ... }
```

The caller must pass the `MustBeInternal` policy and hold either `Admin` or `Manager`.

## Per-Model Authorization

Decorate any `[TraxQueryModel]` entity with `[TraxAuthorize]` to gate the auto-generated GraphQL query. The combinator semantics, role normalization, and inheritance behavior all match the per-train surface above. The only difference is enforcement: Trax attaches HotChocolate's native `@authorize` directive to the generated `ObjectType` *and* to the entry field under `discover`, so the gate fires in two places:

- **Direct entry**: a top-level `discover.<namespace>.<modelField>` request runs the field-level directive before the resolver. Connection-shaped scalars like `totalCount` and `pageInfo` are blocked too; an unauthorized caller cannot enumerate the cardinality of a gated entity.
- **Transitive navigation**: a request that reaches the entity through a navigation property on an ungated parent (`discover.publicOwners.nodes[].privateBooks`) triggers the type-level directive when each child node is materialized. The parent's data is still selected from the database, but the unauthorized response substitutes an error for the gated branch and never returns the row payload to the client.

```csharp
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;
using Trax.Effect.Attributes;

[TraxQueryModel(Namespace = "library")]
[TraxAuthorize(Roles = "Subscriber")]
[Table("articles", Schema = "content")]
public class Article
{
    public long Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; } = "";
    public string Body { get; set; } = "";
}
```

Anonymous and non-subscriber callers hitting `discover.library.articles` (or any field elsewhere in the schema whose return type is `Article`) receive a `TRAX_AUTHORIZATION` error with the public message `"Not authorized."`.

### Combinator Semantics

Identical to the per-train surface. The table below repeats them for reference; see [Per-Train Authorization](#per-train-authorization) for the prose explanation.

| Attribute(s) on the entity | Meaning |
|----------------------------|---------|
| `[TraxAuthorize]` (bare) | Be authenticated. |
| `[TraxAuthorize("P")]` | Policy `P` must pass. |
| `[TraxAuthorize(Roles = "A,B")]` | Hold role `A` OR role `B`. |
| `[TraxAuthorize("P1")] [TraxAuthorize("P2")]` | Both `P1` and `P2` must pass. Policies AND across attributes. |
| `[TraxAuthorize(Roles = "A")] [TraxAuthorize(Roles = "B")]` | Hold role `A` OR role `B`. Roles union OR across attributes. |
| `[TraxAuthorize("P")] [TraxAuthorize(Roles = "A")]` | Policy `P` must pass AND hold role `A`. |

### Startup Validation

`QueryModelAuthorizationValidator` runs as a hosted service at host start. It throws if any entity references an authorization policy that has not been registered via `services.AddAuthorization(...)`. This catches typoed policy names (`"AdmnPolicy"`) before the first request rather than turning the gate into a silent deny-all in production. Roles are not validated against the principal store (Trax has no view of what roles can exist); attribute shape (empty or whitespace-only `Policy`, all-empty `Roles` CSV) is validated at `TraxGraphQLBuilder.Build` time.

### Authentication for Per-Model Gating

Per-model `[TraxAuthorize]` enforcement runs HotChocolate's `@authorize` directive, which evaluates against `HttpContext.User`. ASP.NET Core's `UseAuthentication()` middleware only populates `HttpContext.User` from the **default authentication scheme**, so multi-scheme hosts (api-key + JWT, api-key + cookie, etc.) where no scheme is configured as the default would otherwise leave HC seeing an anonymous principal.

Trax handles this automatically. When any registered `[TraxQueryModel]` entity carries `[TraxAuthorize]`, `AddTraxGraphQL` wires a HotChocolate `IHttpRequestInterceptor` (`QueryModelAuthenticationInterceptor`) that runs before each GraphQL HTTP request. The interceptor:

1. Returns early if the request is already authenticated by upstream middleware or endpoint-level `RequireAuthorization`.
2. Otherwise, walks every registered authentication scheme and attempts `AuthenticateAsync` against each. The first successful scheme wins; the resulting principal is assigned to `HttpContext.User` for the duration of the request.
3. If no scheme matches the request's credentials, the principal stays anonymous - gated queries will then reject with `TRAX_AUTHORIZATION`.

The interceptor runs only for GraphQL HTTP execution requests, so the Banana Cake Pop tool page and WebSocket subscription upgrades are not affected. Subscriptions authenticate separately via the per-scheme socket interceptors (`TraxApiKeySocketInterceptor`, `TraxJwtSocketInterceptor`).

No consumer configuration is required.

### Limitations

- **Field-level gating inside an entity is not supported.** `[TraxAuthorize]` on a property is ignored. If `User.email` must be admin-only but `User.displayName` must be public, use a custom train rather than `[TraxQueryModel]`, or split the entity into two types via `ExposeAs`.
- **Row-level filtering is not supported.** `[TraxAuthorize]` answers "can this user read *this type*", not "which rows of this type." For per-row scoping (tenancy, ownership, subscription tier), use EF Core global query filters that read the current `ClaimsPrincipal` from a scoped service.

## Anonymous Access via [TraxAllowAnonymous]

`[TraxAllowAnonymous]` is the explicit opt-in counterpart to `[TraxAuthorize]`. It declares a GraphQL-exposed surface intentionally public and satisfies the [Required Exposure Posture](#required-exposure-posture) rule. It applies to both `[TraxQueryModel]` entities and `[TraxQuery]`/`[TraxMutation]` trains.

On a query-model entity it opens that entity to unauthenticated GraphQL reads (and, as below, mirrors HotChocolate's `[AllowAnonymous]` cascade behavior). On a train it carries no runtime gate of its own (train authorization is enforced imperatively, not via schema directives); its only effect is to declare the train intentionally public so it passes the exposure check.

```csharp
using Trax.Effect.Attributes;

// An intentionally public train.
[TraxQuery(Namespace = "public")]
[TraxAllowAnonymous]
public class LookupAnnouncementTrain
    : ServiceTrain<LookupAnnouncementInput, AnnouncementOutput>, ILookupAnnouncementTrain
{
    protected override Task<Either<Exception, AnnouncementOutput>> Junctions() =>
        Chain<LookupAnnouncementJunction>().Resolve();
}
```

Decorating a `[TraxQueryModel]` entity with it opens that entity to unauthenticated GraphQL reads.

```csharp
using Trax.Effect.Attributes;

[TraxQueryModel(Namespace = "public")]
[TraxAllowAnonymous]
[Table("announcements", Schema = "content")]
public class PublicAnnouncement
{
    public long Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; } = "";
    public string Body { get; set; } = "";
}
```

Any caller, with or without authentication, can read `discover.public.announcements`. Authenticated callers are not excluded; the attribute just removes the gate.

### Cascade Behavior

`[TraxAllowAnonymous]` is local to the decorated entity. A navigation property whose target type carries `[TraxAuthorize]` still enforces that gate, even when reached through the anonymous parent:

```csharp
[TraxQueryModel(Namespace = "public")]
[TraxAllowAnonymous]
public class PublicAnnouncement
{
    public long Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; } = "";

    public long? RelatedMatchId { get; set; }
    public MatchRecord? RelatedMatch { get; set; }  // gated below
}

[TraxQueryModel(Namespace = "matches")]
[TraxAuthorize(Roles = "Admin")]
public class MatchRecord
{
    public long Id { get; set; }
    public string MatchId { get; set; } = "";
}
```

An anonymous query for `discover.public.announcements { title }` succeeds. The same query selecting `relatedMatch { matchId }` fires the gated child's directive and returns `TRAX_AUTHORIZATION`. The anonymous parent does not propagate openness to its gated children.

### Mutual Exclusion with [TraxAuthorize]

`[TraxAllowAnonymous]` and `[TraxAuthorize]` on the same surface (directly, or via inheritance from a base class or interface) is rejected at host startup with a message naming the type. The two attributes have opposite intents and cannot coexist.

### Contradicts an Endpoint-Level Gate

If the GraphQL endpoint is gated with `RequireAuthorization()`, the HTTP layer rejects unauthenticated callers before HotChocolate ever runs, so a surface can never be reached anonymously. `[TraxAllowAnonymous]` would be a promise the endpoint structurally cannot keep, so declaring it on any exposed surface while the builder opted into `RequireAuthorization()` fails at host startup. Remove one or the other: drop the attribute, or drop the endpoint-level gate if the surface should be publicly reachable. (Standard ASP.NET Core endpoint authorization applied separately on the mapped route, rather than via the Trax builder, does not trip this check, matching HotChocolate's own `[AllowAnonymous]` behavior.)

### Schema Validator Coverage

For query-model entities, the same hosted-service invariant check that asserts `@authorize` is present on gated entities also asserts it is *absent* on `[TraxAllowAnonymous]` entities. A custom `ConfigureSchema` callback that reattaches the directive to an anonymous entity throws at host start with a message naming the entity. The opt-in cannot be silently re-locked.

## Registering Policies

Trax uses standard ASP.NET Core authorization policies. Register them in `Program.cs` the same way you would for any controller or endpoint:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("Admin", policy => policy.RequireRole("Admin"));
    options.AddPolicy("MustBeInternal", policy =>
        policy.RequireClaim("network", "internal"));
});
```

Trax evaluates these policies at runtime using ASP.NET Core's `IAuthorizationService`. If a train requires a policy that isn't registered, the authorization check fails.

## How It Works

1. `ITrainDiscoveryService` reads `[TraxAuthorize]` and `[TraxAllowAnonymous]` attributes across the implementation, its base chain, and every implemented interface. Roles are normalized to upper-invariant; policies are deduplicated. The requirements (and a `HasAllowAnonymousAttribute` flag) are stored on each `TrainRegistration`.
2. `AddTraxGraphQL` enforces the [Required Exposure Posture](#required-exposure-posture) for every exposed train, and `TraxGraphQLBuilder.Build()` does the same for every `[TraxQueryModel]` entity. Both share one rule: a surface with neither marker (on an open endpoint), both markers, or `[TraxAllowAnonymous]` under `RequireAuthorization()` fails startup with a message naming the offending types.
3. At host start, `AuthorizationRegistrationValidator` runs as a hosted service. It throws if any train carries `[TraxAuthorize]` but no `ITrainAuthorizationService` is registered (this can be opted out of per below), and it throws on malformed attribute shapes (empty policy strings, whitespace-only roles) so typos are caught before traffic arrives.
4. When `ITrainExecutionService.QueueAsync()` or `RunAsync()` runs, it invokes the registered `ITrainAuthorizationService`.
5. The default implementation (`TrainAuthorizationService` from `Trax.Api`) is fail-closed. It grabs the current user from `IHttpContextAccessor` and evaluates each requirement:
   - **Policy**: calls `IAuthorizationService.AuthorizeAsync(user, policyName)`.
   - **Roles**: compares the upper-invariant `ClaimTypes.Role` claims against the normalized required set.
6. If any check fails, `TrainAuthorizationException` is thrown. Its public `Message` is always the generic string `"Not authorized."`; the train name, failing policy, and required roles live only on the exception's `TrainName` and `Reason` properties for server-side logging.
7. GraphQL surfaces the error with code `TRAX_AUTHORIZATION` and the same generic message. The train name, policy name, and role names never cross the wire.

### Fail-Closed Behavior

When an `HttpContext` is absent and no trusted execution scope is active, the service denies. This protects against accidental invocation from background services, tests, or custom middleware that bypasses the normal request pipeline. Scheduler and remote-worker paths explicitly mark themselves as trusted via `ITrustedExecutionScope.BeginTrusted(...)` so pre-authorized queued work still runs.

### Opting Out for Scheduler-Only Hosts

A process that registers `[TraxAuthorize]` trains for discovery but never serves API submissions (e.g. a standalone scheduler worker) can opt out of the fail-closed startup check:

```csharp
services.AddTrax(trax => trax
    .AddEffects(effects => effects.UsePostgres(connStr))
    .AddMediator(mediator => mediator
        .ScanAssemblies(typeof(Program).Assembly)
        .AllowMissingAuthorizationService()));
```

Only use this from processes that genuinely never accept API submissions. The flag disables the fail-closed guard; every `[TraxAuthorize]` gated train will run without authorization checks in that process.

## Train Discovery Shows Auth Requirements

The GraphQL `trains` query includes authorization metadata in the response. Consumers can use this to build UIs that show which trains are available and what access they require.

```json
{
  "serviceTypeName": "IDeleteUserTrain",
  "implementationTypeName": "DeleteUserTrain",
  "inputTypeName": "DeleteUserInput",
  "outputTypeName": "Unit",
  "lifetime": "Transient",
  "inputSchema": [ ... ],
  "requiredPolicies": ["Admin"],
  "requiredRoles": []
}
```

Trains without `[TraxAuthorize]` return empty arrays for both fields.

## Combining with Endpoint-Level Auth

Per-train auth and endpoint-level auth are complementary. A typical setup might look like:

```csharp
// All Trax endpoints require authentication
app.UseTraxGraphQL(configure: endpoint => endpoint
    .RequireAuthorization());

// Individual trains require specific policies
[TraxAuthorize("Admin")]
[TraxMutation]
public class AdminOnlyTrain : ServiceTrain<AdminInput, Unit>, IAdminOnlyTrain { ... }
```

The endpoint-level check runs first (before the request reaches the handler). The per-train check runs inside the handler, after the train is resolved by name.

## The Scheduler and Remote Workers Are Trusted

Authorization is enforced once, at API submission time. When a train is queued or run through GraphQL, the request carries an `HttpContext` and the authorization check evaluates against the caller's identity. Work that makes it past that check is written to the queue as already-authorized.

Later execution paths are trusted:

- The scheduler dequeues from `work_queue` and calls `ITrainBus.RunAsync()` directly. It never reaches `ITrainAuthorizationService`.
- Remote workers pull queued work over HTTP and execute it via `ITrainExecutionService.RunAsync()`. Because there is no `HttpContext` on the worker side, the authorization check treats the caller as trusted infrastructure and skips.

This means you can safely decorate a train with `[TraxAuthorize("Admin")]` and still schedule it via `AddScheduler()`, run it from a remote worker, or both. The authorization gate is the API boundary.

## Custom Authorization Logic

If policies and roles aren't enough, you can replace the default `ITrainAuthorizationService` with your own implementation:

```csharp
public class CustomTrainAuthorizationService : ITrainAuthorizationService
{
    public async Task AuthorizeAsync(
        TrainRegistration registration,
        CancellationToken ct = default)
    {
        // Your custom logic here: check a database, call an external service, etc.
        // Throw to deny, return normally to allow.
    }
}

// Register before AddTraxGraphQL (which calls AddTraxApi internally)
builder.Services.AddScoped<ITrainAuthorizationService, CustomTrainAuthorizationService>();
```

The interface is defined in `Trax.Mediator`, so your implementation doesn't need to reference `Trax.Api`.
