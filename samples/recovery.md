# Recovery

A train asks a model which track to take, a later step crashes, and the retry takes the same tracks
without paying for the model again. The Recovery sample makes that visible: a page shows the train's
real C# with the running junction highlighted, a console narrated from live junction events, and a
timeline where attempt 2 follows attempt 1 with a **replayed: model not asked** badge on every
decision it did not have to buy twice.

It proves three features working together, against Postgres, in one process:

| Feature | What the sample shows | Page |
|---|---|---|
| Train decisions | A `Switch` and a `Scale` (research agent), a `Gate` (refund approval), answered by an `IDecider` | [Decisions](/docs/core/decisions) |
| Retries replay decisions | The manifest's automatic retry replays every recorded answer whose state hashes the same, asks afresh when the data changed, and asks afresh on purpose with `askAfresh` | [Retries replay decisions](/docs/scheduler/dead-letters-and-cleanup#retries-replay-decisions) |
| Junction events | `onJunctionEvent` and `operations.junctionRuns` drive the page | [Junction Events](/docs/effect/junction-events) |

The code is in `Trax.Samples/samples/Recovery`; its tests are in
`Trax.Samples/tests/Trax.Samples.Recovery.E2E`.

## Run it

Needs the .NET 10 SDK, Node.js 20 or later, and Docker. From the `Trax.Samples` folder:

```bash
docker compose up -d database
dotnet run --project samples/Recovery/Trax.Samples.Recovery.Api
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd samples/Recovery/Trax.Samples.Recovery.Client
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. The host listens on `http://localhost:5260`, with the dashboard at
`/trax` and the GraphQL IDE at `/trax/graphql`, both in Development only. When your Postgres is not
on 5432, start the host with
`ConnectionStrings__TraxDatabase="Host=localhost;Port=<port>;Database=trax;Username=trax;Password=trax123"`.

## What you'll see

1. **Research agent, crash once, Run.** Attempt 1 runs `PlanResearch`, asks the model `Source`
   (where to look), runs `SearchPapers` on that track, asks `Depth` (how far to dig), and crashes in
   `FetchFullTexts`. The console turns red, the timeline shows "Failed, retrying 1/2". A few seconds
   later the manifest's retry starts as a new execution: `PlanResearch` and `SearchPapers` run again,
   but both questions arrive with `replayed: true` in a fraction of a millisecond, and the run
   completes.
2. **Ask afresh during the backoff.** Pressing **Ask afresh** while attempt 1's failure waits out
   its backoff calls `triggerManifest(externalId, askAfresh: true)`. The retry asks the model both
   questions again; the badge says **asked afresh: on purpose**.
3. **Refund approval, crash once, then change the data.** The model approves order A-1001 (yes at
   0.93), and `IssuePayment` times out. During the backoff, **Change the data during the backoff**
   records an earlier refund on the order. The retry is still queued to replay attempt 1, but the
   refund case it reads no longer hashes the same, so the replay is refused, the model is asked
   afresh (0.58, between the bars), and the refund takes the `Unsure` track to a person instead of
   being paid. The badge says **asked afresh: state changed**.
4. **Ask afresh after a run.** Once a run has completed, **Ask afresh** calls
   `requeueExecution(id, askAfresh: true)` on its last execution, a run of its own outside the
   manifest.

The same over GraphQL, with the header `X-Api-Key: recovery-operator-key-do-not-use-in-production`:

```graphql
mutation {
  dispatch {
    startRun(input: { scenario: REFUND, orderId: "A-1001", crashOnce: true }) {
      output { runId manifestId manifestExternalId }
    }
  }
}

query {
  operations {
    executions(manifestId: 1, order: OLDEST) { items { id trainState failureJunction } }
  }
}

query {
  operations {
    junctionRuns(metadataId: 42) { position kind name state answer replayed trackPosition attempt }
  }
}
```

## How it works

### The host

One ASP.NET process holds the GraphQL API, the scheduler, its local workers and, in Development,
the dashboard. The parts that make recovery work:

```csharp
using Trax.Core.Decisions;                          // IDecider
using Trax.Effect.Data.Extensions;                  // AddDecisionRecording, AddJunctionEvents
using Trax.Effect.Data.Postgres.Extensions;         // UsePostgres
using Trax.Effect.Decisions.SystemOne.Extensions;   // AddNimbleDecider (only with Recovery:Model = Nimble)
using Trax.Effect.Extensions;
using Trax.Effect.Provider.Parameter.Extensions;    // SaveTrainParameters
using Trax.Mediator.Extensions;
using Trax.Scheduler.Extensions;

builder.Services.AddSingleton<IDecider, DemoDecider>();

builder.Services.AddTrax(trax =>
    trax.AddEffects(effects =>
            effects
                .UsePostgres(connectionString)
                .SaveTrainParameters()      // requeueExecution reads a run's saved input
                .AddDecisionRecording()     // trax.decision, and replay on a retry or requeue
                .AddJunctionEvents()        // each junction, question and track, live and stored
        )
        .AddMediator(typeof(DemoDecider).Assembly)
        .AddScheduler(scheduler =>
            scheduler
                // Demo speed only: watch a retry within seconds.
                .ManifestManagerPollingInterval(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1))
                .JobDispatcherPollingInterval(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1))
                .DefaultRetryDelay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(4))
                .RetryBackoffMultiplier(1.0)
                .MaxRetryDelay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10))
                .ConfigureLocalWorkers(w => w.PollingInterval = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(250))
        )
);
```

Every train that runs a decision needs `AddDecisionRecording()` on the hosts that run it; a host
that runs a deciding train without it refuses to start (see
[A host that does not record](/docs/effect/decisions#a-host-that-does-not-record)). The scheduler
values above are for a demo; the defaults (a five-minute retry delay that doubles) are the right
ones for real work.

The refund's state carries a `[TraxSensitive]` member (the customer's email). Without a state hash
key, decision recording writes no hash for a state that can hold a sensitive member, and such an
answer is never replayed. So `appsettings.Development.json` holds a fixed demo key:

```json
{
  "Trax": {
    "Decisions": {
      "StateHashKey": "<base64 of at least 32 bytes>"
    }
  }
}
```

A real host keeps its key with its other secrets, and every process that may run a retry uses the
same one. See [Keying the state hash](/docs/effect/decisions#keying-the-state-hash).

### Who sees what

The page needs each question's answer and the names of the junctions on a track. Over
`onJunctionEvent`, only the operations view carries those; a subscriber outside it sees the run's
shape with answers and track steps withheld. The sample exposes the operations namespace behind a
role, and registers two demo keys in Development only:

```csharp
if (builder.Environment.IsDevelopment())
    builder.Services.AddTraxApiKeyAuth(keys =>
        keys.Add("recovery-operator-key-do-not-use-in-production", id: "operator", "Operator")
            .Add("recovery-viewer-key-do-not-use-in-production", id: "viewer", "Viewer"));

builder.Services.AddTraxGraphQL(graphql =>
    graphql.ExposeOperationQueries().ExposeOperationMutations().GateOperations(roles: "Operator"));
```

The two scenario trains carry `[TraxBroadcast]` and `[TraxAuthorize(Roles = "Operator,Viewer")]`,
so the viewer key follows their steps through the broadcast view. Once a token scheme is
registered, a subscription socket without a credential is refused at `connection_init`, so a
"public" watcher still needs a key. The alternative to an operator key is
`AllowJunctionAnswersForBroadcastSubscribers()`, called inside `IsDevelopment()` only.

Outside Development no key exists, the operations namespace answers no one and the dashboard is
not mapped.

### The trains

Every step is an `EffectJunction`: a plain `Junction` emits no junction events. The research agent:

```csharp
[TraxBroadcast]
[TraxAuthorize(Roles = RecoveryRoles.Operator + "," + RecoveryRoles.Viewer)]
public class ResearchTopicTrain : ServiceTrain<ResearchInput, ResearchReport>, IResearchTopicTrain
{
    protected override Task<Either<Exception, ResearchReport>> Junctions() =>
        Chain<PlanResearch>()
            .Switch<ResearchBrief, Source>(tracks =>
                tracks
                    .When(Source.Web, t => t.Chain<SearchWeb>())
                    .When(Source.Papers, t => t.Chain<SearchPapers>())
                    .When(Source.Wiki, t => t.Chain<SearchWiki>()))
            .Scale<Findings, Depth>(scale =>
                scale
                    .AtLeast(Depth.Skim, t => t.Chain<SkimSources>())
                    .AtLeast(Depth.CrossCheck, t => t.Chain<FetchFullTexts>()))
            .Chain<Summarize>()
            .Resolve();
}
```

Every `Switch` track produces `Findings` and every `Scale` track `CheckedFindings`, because after a
routing step the chain can rely only on what every track produces. The refund approval asks one
yes/no question:

```csharp
Chain<LoadRefundCase>()
    .Gate<RefundCase, ApproveRefund>(gate =>
        gate.Yes(t => t.Chain<IssuePayment>(), atLeast: 0.8)
            .No(t => t.Chain<DeclineRefund>(), below: 0.3)
            .Unsure(t => t.Chain<QueueForReview>()))
    .Chain<NotifyCustomer>()
    .Resolve();
```

A replay needs the state at each decision to hash exactly as it did the first time, so the states
hold only what the model reads and nothing that changes between attempts: no timestamp, no random
id, no cache. `LoadRefundCase` copies the order's amount, reason and earlier refunds into
`RefundCase`, because the hash covers the state and nothing the decider might look up elsewhere.

### The model

`DemoDecider` implements `IDecider`. It waits 0.5 to 1.5 seconds, as a model would, and answers
from the state alone, so the same state always gets the same answer:

```csharp
public async Task<DecisionResult> Decide(DecisionRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    await Task.Delay(Latency(), cancellationToken);
    var answers = new Dictionary<string, Answer>();
    foreach (var question in request.Questions)
        answers[question.Key] = (request.State, question) switch
        {
            (ResearchBrief brief, ChoiceQuestion) => ChooseSource(brief),   // ChoiceAnswer
            (Findings findings, ScoreQuestion) => ScoreDepth(findings),     // ScoreAnswer
            (RefundCase refund, YesNoQuestion) => ApproveRefund(refund),    // YesNoAnswer
            _ => throw new InvalidOperationException($"Cannot answer {question.Key}."),
        };
    return new DecisionResult(answers);
}
```

Set `Recovery:Model` to `Nimble` and `Recovery:Nimble:Endpoint` to a Nimble server you run, and the
host calls `AddNimbleDecider` instead. See [Nimble](/docs/effect/decisions#nimble).

### Starting a run as a one-off manifest

Decisions are replayed only by a manifest's automatic retry, a requeue of its dead letter, or
`requeueExecution`. A train queued through `queueTrain` or run through a mutation never replays, so
the page's **Run** has to create a manifest. Trax.Api has no GraphQL operation for a one-off
manifest, so the sample adds one, a `[TraxMutation]` train whose junction calls
`ITraxScheduler.ScheduleOnceAsync`:

```csharp
[TraxAuthorize(Roles = RecoveryRoles.Operator)]
[TraxMutation(GraphQLOperation.Run, Description = "Starts a recovery demo run as a one-off manifest")]
public class StartRunTrain : ServiceTrain<StartRunInput, StartRunOutput>, IStartRunTrain { ... }

// in its junction
var manifest = await scheduler.ScheduleOnceAsync<IApproveRefundTrain, RefundInput, RefundResult>(
    $"recovery-{runId}",
    new RefundInput { RunId = runId, OrderId = orderId },
    TimeSpan.Zero,
    options => options.MaxRetries(2));
```

`MaxRetries(2)` allows three attempts. The mutation returns the manifest's id, which the page uses
to find each attempt with `operations.executions(manifestId:)`.

### Crashing once without changing the input

A retry replays only when the manifest's input is byte-identical between attempts, so a "crash
here" flag cannot live in the input. `FaultInjector` is a singleton keyed by the run id the input
already carries. `startRun` arms it, and the crashing junction fires it once:

```csharp
if (faults.TryFire(findings.RunId, CrashPoint.ToolCall))
    throw new HttpRequestException("The full-text service dropped the connection (crash injected by the demo).");
```

Killing the worker process would not show a recovery: a killed run is failed by stuck-job recovery
much later, or at the next start, not resumed.

### Changing the data during the backoff

`changeCaseData` edits the order the next attempt will read, not the manifest's input. The retry is
therefore still linked to the failed run (`replay_decisions_of`), and the replay itself refuses the
answer: its recorded `state_hash` no longer matches the state the question is asked about now. The
refusal is stored as `replay_refused` in the new row's answer. The run is not marked
`replay_abandoned`, which is kept for a replay that could not be honoured at all (the named run gone,
a host that does not record).

### The page

The page is React 19, Vite, Apollo Client and `graphql-ws`, with subscriptions split onto a
`GraphQLWsLink` as in the Chat Service sample. The key travels in the
`connection_init` payload as `apiKey`, because a browser cannot set headers on a WebSocket upgrade.
For each attempt it:

1. polls `operations.executions(manifestId:)` until the attempt's execution exists;
2. subscribes to `onJunctionEvent(metadataId:)`;
3. then reads `operations.junctionRuns(metadataId:)` and merges both by `position`, keeping
   whichever copy of a step is further along, because the stored rows trail the stream and steps
   published before the subscription started reach it only through the table;
4. once the attempt ends, reads the decision journal.

Junction events say whether an answer was `replayed`, not why one was not. The sample adds a small
`[TraxQuery]` train, `decisionJournal(metadataId)`, that reads `IDataContext.RecordedDecisions` and
the run's `ReplayDecisionsOf` and `ReplayAbandoned`, so the page can tell **asked afresh: state
changed** (a `replay_refused` reason) from **asked afresh: on purpose** (no replay link).

A `ROUTE` step carries `replayed: false` even when the decision it routes on was replayed; the
badge reads the question's step.

The code panel imports the trains' `.cs` files raw at build time and highlights the line of the
running step: `Chain<Name>` for a junction, the routing step for a question, and the track's
`.When(...)`, `.AtLeast(...)` or `.Yes(...)` for a route.

## The tests

`Trax.Samples.Recovery.E2E` boots the real host with `WebApplicationFactory` against the
`recovery_e2e_tests` database (port 5432, or `TRAX_TEST_PG_PORT`), with a counting decider in place
of the demo one, and asserts over GraphQL:

| Test | Proves |
|---|---|
| `ResearchRun_CrashedOnce_CompletesOnAttempt2_WithoutAskingTheModelAgain` | Attempt 2 completes; the decider was asked each question once across both attempts; attempt 2's decision events have `replayed: true`, live and stored |
| `RefundRun_PaymentTimedOutOnce_RetryTakesTheSameTrackWithoutAskingAgain` | The gate replays its answer; the state hash is keyed (`k1:`) |
| `RunWithNoCrashArmed_CompletesInOneAttempt` | One attempt, and the once manifest disables itself |
| `TriggerWithAskAfresh_DuringTheBackoff_RetryAsksTheModelAgain` | `triggerManifest(askAfresh: true)` makes the retry ask again |
| `RequeueExecution_ReplaysByDefault_AndAsksAgainWithAskAfresh` | `requeueExecution` replays; with `askAfresh: true` it asks again |
| `DataChangedDuringTheBackoff_RetryAsksAfresh_AndTakesTheTrackTheNewDataCallsFor` | The retry stays linked, refuses the answer for a changed state, asks afresh and takes `Unsure` |
| `ViewerSubscriber_SeesTheShape_ButNotTheAnswersOrTheTrack` | The broadcast view gets no answers, and every step on a track is `(withheld)` |

```bash
TRAX_TEST_PG_PORT=5432 dotnet test tests/Trax.Samples.Recovery.E2E
