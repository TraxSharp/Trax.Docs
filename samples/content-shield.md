# Content Shield

`samples/EphemeralWorkers` in [Trax.Samples](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples) is a content
moderation API whose trains all run somewhere else: on a runner that is an AWS Lambda function in
production and a local Kestrel server in development. The API holds no workers and writes no
`background_job` rows. It POSTs each queued job to the runner and returns, and it POSTs each
synchronous run and waits for the answer.

## What it proves

| Feature | Where |
|---|---|
| Queued mutations dispatched over HTTP with `UseRemoteWorkers`; nothing reaches `background_job` | `RemoteExecutionTests` |
| Every synchronous run (run mutations and `[TraxQuery]` queries) sent to the runner with `UseRemoteRun` | `RemoteExecutionTests.Query_is_run_on_the_runner` |
| A runner that is a `TraxLambdaFunction`, served locally by `RunLocalAsync` | `Runner/Function.cs`, `Runner/Program.cs` |
| A signing key shared by both sides; an unsigned request to the runner gets `401` | `RunnerSigningKey.cs`, `AuthorizationTests` |
| The runner's lifecycle events reaching a GraphQL subscriber on the API over RabbitMQ | `CrossProcessEventTests` |
| Testing a Lambda runner end to end without AWS | `tests/Trax.Samples.ContentShield.E2E/Fixtures/TestRunner.cs` |

## Layout

├── Trax.Samples.ContentShield/          trains, roles, RunnerSigningKey

```

## Run

From the `Trax.Samples` root:

```bash
docker compose up -d       # Postgres on 5432, RabbitMQ on 5672 (user trax, password trax123)

# Terminal 1: the runner on http://localhost:5205
dotnet run --project samples/EphemeralWorkers/Trax.Samples.ContentShield.Runner

# Terminal 2: the API on http://localhost:5204
dotnet run --project samples/EphemeralWorkers/Trax.Samples.ContentShield.Api
```

Both start in Development through `Properties/launchSettings.json` (`ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` for the
API, `DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT` for the runner) and sign with a published demo key. Anywhere else, set
`Trax__RunnerSigningKey` to the same value on both, the base64 of 32 or more random bytes
(`openssl rand -base64 32`); without it the API refuses to start with
`Set Trax:RunnerSigningKey to the base64 of 32 or more random bytes ...`.

## Try it

```bash
# Look up a moderation result (anonymous; the API waits while the runner runs it)
curl -s http://localhost:5204/trax/graphql -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ discover { moderation { lookupModerationResult(input: {contentId: \"test-001\"}) { contentId moderationStatus classification threatScore } } } }"}'

# Queue a review (anonymous). It returns at once; the runner's console logs the review.
curl -s http://localhost:5204/trax/graphql -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"mutation { dispatch { moderation { reviewContent(input: {contentId: \"test-002\", contentType: \"video\", contentBody: \"suspicious video content\"}) { externalId workQueueId } } } }"}'

# Run a report on the runner and wait for the output (Moderator key, Development only)
curl -s http://localhost:5204/trax/graphql -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: contentshield-moderator-key-do-not-use-in-production" \
  -d '{"query":"mutation { dispatch { reports { generateModerationReport(input: {reportPeriod: \"Daily\"}) { externalId output { totalReviewed totalFlagged topViolationTypes falsePositiveRate } } } } }"}'

# The runner refuses anything not signed with the key
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -X POST http://localhost:5205/trax/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

The report answers with its output, and the last command prints `401`. The same report without the
key answers `Not authorized.` with code `TRAX_AUTHORIZATION`.

## How it works

### The API dispatches everything

```csharp
using Trax.Samples.ContentShield;
using Trax.Scheduler.Extensions;

var runnerBaseUrl = builder.Configuration["Runner:BaseUrl"] ?? "http://localhost:5205";
var runnerKey = RunnerSigningKey.Resolve(builder.Configuration, builder.Environment.IsDevelopment());

builder.Services.AddTrax(trax =>
    trax.AddEffects(effects =>
            effects
                .UsePostgres(connectionString)
                .UseBroadcaster(b => b.UseRabbitMq(rabbitMqConnectionString))
        )
        .AddMediator(mediator => mediator.ScanAssemblies(typeof(ReviewContentTrain).Assembly))
        .AddScheduler(scheduler =>
            scheduler
                .UseRemoteWorkers(
                    remote =>
                    {
                        remote.BaseUrl = $"{runnerBaseUrl}/trax/execute";
                        remote.SigningKey = runnerKey;
                    },
                    routing =>
                        routing
                            .ForTrain<IReviewContentTrain>()
                            .ForTrain<ISendViolationNoticeTrain>()
                            .ForTrain<IGenerateModerationReportTrain>()
                )
                .UseRemoteRun(remote =>
                {
                    remote.BaseUrl = $"{runnerBaseUrl}/trax/run";
                    remote.SigningKey = runnerKey;
                })
        )
);
```

`UseRemoteWorkers` routes the named trains' queued runs to the runner. A train it does not route
still falls back to the local worker, which is why the API process still registers
`LocalWorkerService`; every queueable ContentShield train is routed, so that worker never has a job.

`UseRemoteRun` replaces the in-process run executor for **every** synchronous run, which includes
`[TraxQuery]` queries as well as mutations in `RUN` mode. So even `lookupModerationResult` travels to
the runner. Leave `UseRemoteRun` out if queries should run on the API.

### The runner is a Lambda function

```csharp
using Amazon.Lambda.Core;
using Amazon.Lambda.Serialization.SystemTextJson;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Trax.Effect.Broadcaster.RabbitMQ.Extensions;
using Trax.Effect.Data.Postgres.Extensions;
using Trax.Effect.Extensions;
using Trax.Mediator.Extensions;
using Trax.Runner.Lambda;
using Trax.Scheduler.Configuration;

[assembly: LambdaSerializer(typeof(DefaultLambdaJsonSerializer))]

public class Function : TraxLambdaFunction
{
    protected override void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        services.AddTrax(trax =>
            trax.AddEffects(effects =>
                    effects
                        .UsePostgres(configuration.GetConnectionString("TraxDatabase")!)
                        .UseBroadcaster(b => b.UseRabbitMq(configuration.GetConnectionString("RabbitMQ")!))
                )
                .AddMediator(typeof(ReviewContentTrain).Assembly)
        );
    }

    // Without a posture the function refuses every request.
    protected override void ConfigureRunner(TraxJobRunnerOptions runner, IConfiguration configuration) =>
        runner.SigningKey = RunnerSigningKey.Resolve(configuration, IsDevelopment(configuration));
}
```

A runner runs what it is sent as already authorized, so it refuses every request until it knows who
may send work. The signing key is that answer: the API signs each request body with it, and the runner
checks the `Trax-Signature` header before reading the body. See
[Remote Execution: Authorization Posture](/docs/scheduler/remote-execution#authorization-posture).

The function reads its configuration from `appsettings.json` next to the binary and from environment
variables (`ConnectionStrings__TraxDatabase`, `Trax__RunnerSigningKey`, `DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT`). It does
not see command-line arguments, and it has no `IHostEnvironment`, which is why `IsDevelopment` reads
`DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT` from configuration.

Locally, `Program.cs` serves the function over HTTP:

```csharp
await new Function().RunLocalAsync([$"--contentRoot={AppContext.BaseDirectory}", .. args]);
```

The `--contentRoot` argument matters. The Kestrel server `RunLocalAsync` starts reads
`appsettings.json` from its content root, which defaults to the current directory, while the
function reads the copy next to the binary. Started from the repository root without it, the runner
finds no Kestrel endpoint and listens on 5000 instead of 5205, and the API's requests go nowhere.

For production, swap `UseRemoteWorkers` and `UseRemoteRun` for `UseLambdaWorkers` and `UseLambdaRun`
(package `Trax.Scheduler.Lambda`), which invoke the function through the AWS SDK with no public
endpoint, with the same `SigningKey`. See
[Lambda Workers](/docs/scheduler/remote-execution#model-2c-lambda-workers-direct-invocation).

### Who may do what

Anyone may submit content (`reviewContent`) and look up a result. `sendViolationNotice` and
`generateModerationReport` carry `[TraxAuthorize(Roles = "Moderator")]`; the only key with that role
is a demo key registered in Development. The runner needs no authorization service for them: a remote
run executes inside a trusted scope, because the API already checked the caller. The dashboard is
registered and served only in Development, with `AllowAnonymousDashboard()`.

Subscriptions need a credential even for anonymous trains. Once an API-key scheme is registered,
every WebSocket must carry a key in its `connection_init` payload, and a socket without one is
refused; see [Subscriptions: Authentication](/docs/sdk-reference/graphql-api/subscriptions#authentication).

## Tests

```bash
TRAX_TEST_PG_PORT=5432 dotnet test tests/Trax.Samples.ContentShield.E2E
```

No AWS is involved. The suite starts the real `Function` through `RunLocalAsync` on a free port, from
a subclass that overrides `BuildServiceProvider` only to supply the test database and broker and to
count the requests the runner handles, and points the API's `Runner:BaseUrl` at it. Both use the
`contentshield_e2e_tests` database.

| Test class | Proves |
|---|---|
| `RemoteExecutionTests` | A query and a run mutation reach `/trax/run`, a queued review reaches `/trax/execute`, and no `background_job` row is written |
| `AuthorizationTests` | Reports and notices refuse an anonymous caller; the runner refuses unsigned requests on both routes |
| `CrossProcessEventTests` | A review the runner finishes reaches an `onTrainCompleted` subscriber on the API |
| `DocumentedExamplesTests` | Every curl command in the API's header works as written |
