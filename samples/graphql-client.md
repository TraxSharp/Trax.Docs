# GraphQL Client

`samples/GraphQLClient` in [Trax.Samples](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples) calls GraphQL
servers from .NET code with `Trax.Api.GraphQL.Client`. Each request is validated against the
server's schema before it is sent, so a query the server cannot answer fails in the caller, with no
HTTP round trip. Everything runs in memory: no database, no broker.

## What it proves

| Feature | Where |
|---|---|
| One consumer, two Trax servers with different schemas, through two keyed clients in one container | `Gateway/Program.cs`, `KeyedClientE2ETests` |
| A query written for one server refused by the other's client with `GraphQLValidationException`, before any HTTP call | `KeyedClientE2ETests` |
| Typed requests reaching a Trax namespace with `Path = "discover.<namespace>"` | `Gateway/Requests/KeyedRequests.cs` |
| The three ways to write a request: raw string (A), embedded `.graphql` resource (E), typed POCO (D) | `Trax.Samples.GraphQLClient/Requests/` |
| A client validating against the server's own schema configuration (`UseAssemblySchema`), so the two cannot drift | `Trax.Samples.GraphQLClient/Program.cs` |

## Layout

```
samples/GraphQLClient/
├── Trax.Samples.GraphQLClient.InventoryServer/   Trax server: discover { inventory { getProduct } }
├── Trax.Samples.GraphQLClient.BillingServer/     Trax server: discover { billing { getInvoice } }
├── Trax.Samples.GraphQLClient.Gateway/           starts both, calls each through its keyed client
└── Trax.Samples.GraphQLClient/                   a HotChocolate server and a client in modes A, E, D
```

## Run

From the `Trax.Samples` root:

```bash
dotnet run --project samples/GraphQLClient/Trax.Samples.GraphQLClient.Gateway
dotnet run --project samples/GraphQLClient/Trax.Samples.GraphQLClient
```

The inventory and billing servers can also run on their own
(`dotnet run --project samples/GraphQLClient/Trax.Samples.GraphQLClient.BillingServer`), serving
GraphQL at `/trax/graphql` and health at `/trax/health`.

## Try it

The Gateway starts both servers on ports 5310 and 5311 and prints:

```text
serverB (inventory) -> Mechanical Keyboard, 42 on hand
serverC (billing)   -> invoice INV-1: 4999c (Paid)
serverB rejected a billing query (schema isolation holds)
```

The modes sample ends with:

```text
  A == E (raw vs resource) : True
  A ~ D (raw vs typed)     : True
```

## How it works

### The servers are ordinary Trax hosts

```csharp
using Trax.Api.Extensions;
using Trax.Api.GraphQL.Extensions;
using Trax.Effect.Data.InMemory.Extensions;
using Trax.Effect.Extensions;
using Trax.Effect.Provider.Json.Extensions;
using Trax.Mediator.Extensions;

builder.Services.AddAuthorization();
builder.Services.AddTrax(trax =>
    trax.AddEffects(effects => effects.UseInMemory().AddJson())
        .AddMediator(mediator =>
            mediator
                .ScanAssemblies(typeof(IGetInvoiceTrain).Assembly)
                .AllowMissingAuthorizationService()
        )
);
builder.Services.AddTraxGraphQL(graphql => graphql.AllowIntrospection(_ => true));
builder.Services.AddHealthChecks().AddTraxHealthCheck();

var app = builder.Build();
app.UseTraxGraphQL();
app.MapHealthChecks("/trax/health");
```

The one train is `[TraxAllowAnonymous]` and `[TraxQuery(Namespace = "billing")]`, which serves it at
`discover { billing { getInvoice(input: ...) } }`. The client validates against the schema it fetches
by introspection, and a Trax server answers introspection only in Development unless the host passes
`AllowIntrospection` a predicate. These demo servers admit everyone; a production server admits only
the callers it trusts, or the client uses `UseFileSchema` or `UseAssemblySchema` instead. See
[GraphQL Client: Schema Providers](/docs/api-graphql-client#schema-providers).

### Two keyed clients in one container

```csharp
using Trax.Api.GraphQL.Client;

var services = new ServiceCollection();
services.AddKeyedTraxGraphQLClient("serverB", new Uri("http://localhost:5310/trax/graphql"));
services.AddKeyedTraxGraphQLClient("serverC", new Uri("http://localhost:5311/trax/graphql"));

await using var provider = services.BuildServiceProvider();
var inventory = provider.GetRequiredKeyedService<IGraphQLClientExecutor>("serverB");
var billing = provider.GetRequiredKeyedService<IGraphQLClientExecutor>("serverC");

var product = await inventory.Run(new GetProductRequest { Input = new GetProductInput("SKU-1") });
```

The key names the server; each executor validates against its own server's schema. Running
`GetInvoiceRequest` through the inventory executor throws `GraphQLValidationException`, because the
inventory schema has no `getInvoice`.

### A typed request into a Trax namespace

```csharp
using Trax.Api.GraphQL.Client.Typed;

[GraphQLType("GetProductOutput")]
public sealed record ProductView(string Sku, string Name, int QuantityOnHand);

[GraphQLOperation(OperationType.Query, Path = "discover.inventory", RootField = "getProduct")]
public sealed class GetProductRequest : TypedRequest<ProductView>
{
    [GraphQLArgument("GetProductInput!", VariableName = "input")]
    public required GetProductInput Input { get; init; }
}
```

The record's properties are the selection set; `Path` wraps the root field in the `discover` and
namespace levels Trax generates, and the response is unwrapped along the same path. See
[GraphQL Client: Nested envelopes](/docs/api-graphql-client#nested-envelopes-path).

## Tests

```bash
dotnet test tests/Trax.Samples.GraphQLClient.E2E
```

`KeyedClientE2ETests` boots both Trax servers with `WebApplicationFactory` and builds one container
with two keyed clients, each handed its server's in-process `HttpClient` through
`.ConfigureHttpClient(factory.CreateClient())`: each key queries its own server, unknown ids fall
back, and a query sent through the wrong key fails schema validation. The modes sample
(`Trax.Samples.GraphQLClient`) has no test of its own; it checks itself when run.
