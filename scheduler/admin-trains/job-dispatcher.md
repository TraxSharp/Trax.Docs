# JobDispatcherTrain

The JobDispatcher is the single gateway between the work queue and the job submitter. It reads `Queued` entries, enforces both global and per-group `MaxActiveJobs` limits, creates Metadata records, and enqueues to the configured `IJobSubmitter` implementation.

## Chain

```
LoadQueuedJobsJunction → LoadDispatchCapacityJunction → ApplyCapacityLimitsJunction → DispatchJobsJunction
```

## Junctions

### LoadQueuedJobsJunction

Loads `WorkQueue` entries with `Status = Queued`, filtering out entries whose `ManifestGroup` has `IsEnabled = false` and entries whose `ScheduledAt` is in the future.

#### Group-Fair Batching

When `MaxQueuedJobsPerCycle` is set (default: 100), the junction uses a window function (`ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY manifest_group_id)`) to load up to that many entries **per manifest group**. This ensures every group with queued work is represented in the loaded batch, preventing a single high-priority group from monopolizing the batch and starving lower-priority groups.

Without group-fair batching, if a high-priority group floods the queue (e.g., 841 entries from a `ScheduleMany` call), a flat `ORDER BY priority LIMIT 100` would load only that group's entries. `ApplyCapacityLimitsJunction` would cap the group and skip the rest — but entries from other groups would never be loaded, even when they have available capacity.

Manual entries (no manifest) are always included regardless of the per-group limit.

Set `MaxQueuedJobsPerCycle` to `null` to disable the limit and load all queued entries without group-fair batching.

```csharp
.AddScheduler(scheduler => scheduler
    .MaxQueuedJobsPerCycle(200)  // load up to 200 entries per group per cycle
)
```

#### Ordering

After loading, entries are sorted by three keys:

1. **ManifestGroup.Priority** (descending) — higher priority groups are dispatched first.
2. **WorkQueue.Priority** (descending) — within a group, higher priority entries come first.
3. **CreatedAt** (ascending) — FIFO tiebreaker within the same priority.

This ordering is applied in-memory after the database query returns, since EF Core wraps `FromSqlRaw` in a subquery when navigation properties are included and Postgres does not guarantee `ORDER BY` preservation through subqueries.

### DispatchJobsJunction

The core of the dispatcher. For each entry that passes the capacity checks in earlier junctions, the dispatcher atomically claims and dispatches it within its own DI scope and database transaction.

**Atomic claim via `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`**: before dispatching an entry, the junction re-selects it from the database with a row-level lock:

```sql
SELECT * FROM trax.work_queue
WHERE id = :entry_id AND status = 'queued'
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
```

If the entry has already been claimed by another server (locked in another transaction or already `Dispatched`), the query returns no rows and the entry is skipped. This prevents duplicate dispatch in multi-server deployments. See [Multi-Server Concurrency](../concurrency.md#jobdispatcher-row-level-locking) for details.

For each successfully claimed entry, the dispatcher:

1. **Deserializes the input**: uses `InputTypeName` to resolve the CLR type, then deserializes `Input` from JSON. Type resolution searches all loaded assemblies. The `TrainName` stored in the work queue entry is the canonical interface name (e.g. `MyApp.Trains.IProcessOrderTrain`), set during scheduling or queue submission.

2. **Creates a Metadata record**: a new `Metadata` row with `TrainState = Pending`, linked to the manifest (if present). Saved immediately so it gets a database-generated ID.

3. **Updates the work queue entry**: sets `Status = Dispatched`, records the `MetadataId` and `DispatchedAt` timestamp.

4. **Commits the transaction**: the Metadata creation and WorkQueue status update are committed as a single atomic unit. This makes the Metadata visible to the job submitter before enqueue.

5. **Enqueues to the job submitter**: calls `IJobSubmitter.EnqueueAsync` with the metadata ID, deserialized input, and the work queue entry's **priority**. The priority flows from the WorkQueue entry to the `background_job` table, where `LocalWorkerService` dequeues by `priority DESC, created_at ASC`. This ensures high-priority jobs are executed before low-priority ones. This happens after commit because the `InMemoryJobSubmitter` executes the train synchronously and needs to read the committed Metadata.

Each entry is processed in its own DI scope with a fresh `IDataContext`. If any individual entry fails (type resolution, serialization, database error), its transaction is rolled back, the error is logged, and the loop continues to the next entry. One bad entry doesn't affect the rest of the queue.

## Parallel Dispatch

By default, `DispatchJobsJunction` processes entries sequentially — one `TryClaimAndDispatchAsync` at a time. This is optimal for local workers where `EnqueueAsync` is a fast database INSERT. But when using `UseRemoteWorkers()`, each dispatch is an HTTP POST that blocks until the remote endpoint finishes executing the train. Sequential dispatch in this scenario means cycle duration scales linearly with the number of entries.

`MaxConcurrentDispatch` controls how many entries are dispatched in parallel within a single polling cycle:

```csharp
.AddScheduler(scheduler => scheduler
    .MaxConcurrentDispatch(10)
    .UseRemoteWorkers(
        remote => remote.BaseUrl = "https://my-workers.example.com/trax/execute",
        routing => routing.ForTrain<IHeavyComputeTrain>())
)
```

When `MaxConcurrentDispatch > 1`, the junction uses a `SemaphoreSlim` to bound concurrency and `Task.WhenAll` to dispatch entries in parallel. Each entry still gets its own DI scope and database transaction — the `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` pattern ensures no two concurrent dispatches claim the same entry, even within the same cycle.

| `MaxConcurrentDispatch` | Behavior |
|-------------------------|----------|
| `1` (default) | Sequential `foreach` loop — zero overhead, exact backward compatibility |
| `> 1` | Parallel dispatch bounded by `SemaphoreSlim` — entries are started in priority order but may complete in any order |

**Considerations:**
- Each concurrent dispatch opens its own database connection. Keep the value well below your connection pool size (default Npgsql pool: 100).
- Priority ordering within a cycle is best-effort when dispatching in parallel — entries are *started* in priority order, but complete in arbitrary order. This matches the existing behavior in multi-server deployments.
- Error handling is per-entry: if one dispatch fails (HTTP timeout, network error), the others continue. Failed dispatches mark their Metadata as `Failed` immediately, same as the sequential path.

## MaxActiveJobs Enforcement

Capacity is enforced at two independent levels: global and per-group.

### Global MaxActiveJobs

The global limit works the same as before. The count is based on `Metadata` rows in `Pending` or `InProgress` state, excluding administrative trains (and any types registered via `ExcludeFromMaxActiveJobs<T>()`). The capacity count query uses a `HashSet<string>` for excluded train names, which Npgsql translates to a single parameterized `<> ALL(@excluded)` array comparison instead of N separate `NOT LIKE` clauses. This allows PostgreSQL to use the covering partial index on active metadata efficiently.

The count happens once at the start of each dispatch cycle, not per-entry. If you have `MaxActiveJobs = 100` and 95 are active, the dispatcher will take up to 5 entries from the queue. The remaining entries stay `Queued` and get picked up on the next polling cycle.

Setting `MaxActiveJobs` to `null` disables the global check entirely—all queued entries are dispatched (subject to per-group limits).

```csharp
.AddScheduler(scheduler => scheduler
    .MaxActiveJobs(100)                              // limit to 100 concurrent jobs
    .ExcludeFromMaxActiveJobs<IMyInternalTrain>() // don't count these
)
```

### Per-Group MaxActiveJobs

Each `ManifestGroup` can have its own `MaxActiveJobs` limit, configured from the dashboard on the ManifestGroup detail page. A group's active count only includes jobs belonging to that group—limits are completely independent across groups.

Both limits are enforced simultaneously. In practice, a group can dispatch at most `min(group limit, remaining global capacity)` jobs in a given cycle. When a group hits its per-group cap, the dispatcher uses `continue` to skip that group's entries and keeps processing entries from other groups. This prevents a single busy group from starving lower-traffic groups that still have capacity.

### How Global and Per-Group Limits Interact

The global `MaxActiveJobs` is a hard ceiling on total concurrent jobs across all groups. Per-group limits are independent caps within that ceiling. When the sum of per-group limits exceeds the global limit, the global limit wins — not every group can run at full capacity simultaneously.

The dispatcher processes entries in priority order and applies two checks with different behaviors:

- **Global limit hit** → `break` — stops all further dispatching for this cycle.
- **Per-group limit hit** → `continue` — skips that group's entry but keeps processing other groups.

This means higher-priority groups consume global capacity first, but a group hitting its own cap doesn't waste the remaining global slots — they flow to lower-priority groups.

#### Example

**Setup:**
- Global `MaxActiveJobs = 5`
- Group A: `MaxActiveJobs = 3`, `Priority = 20`
- Group B: `MaxActiveJobs = 3`, `Priority = 10`
- Currently 0 active jobs, 4 queued in each group

Because Group A has higher priority, its entries appear first in the sorted queue.

| # | Entry | Global Check | Group Check | Result |
|---|-------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | A-1 | 0 + 1 ≤ 5 ✓ | 0 + 1 ≤ 3 ✓ | **Dispatched** |
| 2 | A-2 | 0 + 2 ≤ 5 ✓ | 0 + 2 ≤ 3 ✓ | **Dispatched** |
| 3 | A-3 | 0 + 3 ≤ 5 ✓ | 0 + 3 ≤ 3 ✓ | **Dispatched** |
| 4 | A-4 | 0 + 4 ≤ 5 ✓ | 0 + 3 ≥ 3 ✗ | **Skipped** (group cap) |
| 5 | B-1 | 0 + 4 ≤ 5 ✓ | 0 + 1 ≤ 3 ✓ | **Dispatched** |
| 6 | B-2 | 0 + 5 ≤ 5 ✓ | 0 + 2 ≤ 3 ✓ | **Dispatched** |
| 7 | B-3 | 0 + 6 > 5 ✗ | — | **Stopped** (global cap) |

**Result:** 5 jobs dispatched — Group A gets 3 (its per-group max), Group B gets 2 (limited by the remaining global capacity, not its own cap). Group B's remaining entry stays `Queued` and is picked up on the next polling cycle once a slot frees up.

**Key takeaway:** Per-group limits exceeding the global limit is a valid and useful configuration. It means each group *could* use up to its limit if other groups are idle, but when all groups are busy, the global limit determines the overall throughput and priority determines who gets slots first.

## Why a Separate Train

Before the JobDispatcher existed, the ManifestManager handled dispatch directly. `MaxActiveJobs` was checked in its `EnqueueJobsJunction`. That worked fine when the ManifestManager was the only source of job execution.

But other sources exist: `TriggerAsync` for manual triggers, the dashboard for re-runs. Each of those had to independently create Metadata and enqueue to Hangfire, bypassing the ManifestManager's capacity check entirely.

The work queue + JobDispatcher pattern fixes this. All sources write to the same queue. The JobDispatcher is the only thing that reads from it. Capacity enforcement happens exactly once, in one place.
