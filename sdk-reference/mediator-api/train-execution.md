# TrainExecution

`ITrainExecutionService` provides programmatic train execution by name. Instead of resolving a specific train interface, you pass the train's service type name and a JSON string. The service handles discovery, deserialization, and dispatch. Train lookup matches by fully-qualified canonical name first (`ServiceType.FullName`), then by friendly name (`ServiceTypeName`). There is no short-name fallback.

It supports two execution paths:
- **Queue**: creates a WorkQueue entry for asynchronous dispatch by the scheduler.
- **Run**: executes the train synchronously via `ITrainBus` on the current machine.

Registered automatically by `AddMediator()` as a scoped service.

## ITrainExecutionService

```csharp
public interface ITrainExecutionService
{
    Task<QueueTrainResult> QueueAsync(
        string trainName,
        string? inputJson,
        int priority = 0,
        DateTime? scheduledAt = null,
        CancellationToken ct = default
    );

    Task<RunTrainResult> RunAsync(
        string trainName,
        string inputJson,
        CancellationToken ct = default
    );
}
```

## QueueAsync

Creates a WorkQueue entry for asynchronous execution. The scheduler picks up the entry on its next polling cycle and dispatches the train.

```csharp
Task<QueueTrainResult> QueueAsync(
    string trainName,
    string? inputJson,
    int priority = 0,
    DateTime? scheduledAt = null,
    CancellationToken ct = default
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `trainName` | `string` | Yes | N/A | Train name, matched by canonical name (`ServiceType.FullName`), then friendly name (`ServiceTypeName`). Prefer the fully-qualified interface name (e.g. `"MyApp.Trains.IProcessOrderTrain"`). |
| `inputJson` | `string?` | Yes | N/A | JSON-serialized input matching the train's `InputType`. Null or blank is read as an empty object, `{}`. |
| `priority` | `int` | No | `0` | Dispatch priority (0-31, higher runs first) |
| `scheduledAt` | `DateTime?` | No | `null` | Earliest time the entry may be dispatched, stored as UTC. A `Local` value is converted; an `Unspecified` one is taken to already be UTC, which is how a timestamp without an offset arrives from JSON. Null dispatches as soon as a worker is free. |
| `ct` | `CancellationToken` | No | `default` | Cancellation token |

**Returns**: `QueueTrainResult`

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `WorkQueueId` | `long` | Database ID of the created WorkQueue entry |
| `ExternalId` | `string` | External ID assigned to the entry |

**Throws**:
- `TrainNotFoundException` (an `InvalidOperationException`) if no train is registered with the given name. Use `ITrainDiscoveryService.DiscoverTrains()` to list available trains.
- `AmbiguousTrainNameException` if the name matches more than one train's friendly name.
- `TrainInputValidationException` if `inputJson` exceeds the configured size cap (`WithMaxInputJsonBytes`, 256 KiB by default).
- `JsonException` if `inputJson` does not deserialize to the train's input type. That includes a null or blank `inputJson` for an input type that cannot be built from `{}`, such as one with a `required` member: it fails here, at enqueue, rather than at dispatch.
- `JsonException` if `inputJson` is the JSON literal `null`, which is well-formed but is not an input.
- `TrainAuthorizationException` if the train has `[TraxAuthorize]` requirements the caller does not meet. Authorization runs before the input is read, and applies to every caller-built enqueue, including the operations surface (`queueTrain`, `requeueExecution`). The dashboard's queue dialog and re-queue button also route through this method, but inside a trusted execution scope, so per-train requirements are skipped there; the dashboard is gated by its host. `Trax.Docs/adr/0017` records why.
- `InvalidOperationException` if the train declares `[TraxAuthorize]` and no `ITrainAuthorizationService` is registered, unless the call runs inside a trusted execution scope. The check fails closed; a host that serves no API submissions opts out with `AddMediator(m => m.AllowMissingAuthorizationService())`, after which the missing service is a no-op.
- Any exception thrown by the train's `QueueSubjectKey` override. A key that cannot be computed aborts the enqueue rather than becoming null.
- `InvalidOperationException` if `QueueSubjectKey` returns an empty string or a key longer than 512 characters. Return null for an entry that should not be serialized.
- Any exception thrown by the train's [`OnQueue`](/docs/core/trains-and-junctions#onqueue-enqueue-time-hook) hook, if the train overrides it. A throw aborts the enqueue and leaves no entry behind: on the default path the hook runs before the entry is committed, and for a train that defers promotion the already-staged entry is removed (only if it is still staged, never once promoted or dispatched), whether or not the caller has cancelled. A failure to remove it does not replace the hook's exception; the stale staged entry sweep resolves an entry left behind.
- `InvalidOperationException` for a train that defers promotion, when its staged entry stopped being staged while the hook ran (an operator cancelled it, or the stale staged entry sweep resolved it because the hook outlived `StaleStagedEntryTimeout`). The work will not run, but the hook's side-effect may already have been applied, and the message says so.

### What it does

1. Looks up the train by `trainName` via `ITrainDiscoveryService`.
2. Authorizes the caller against the train's requirements, failing closed as described under **Throws**.
3. Deserializes `inputJson` to the train's `InputType`, reading null or blank as `{}`, so `OnQueue` and `QueueSubjectKey` always receive a real input.
4. Re-serializes the input using manifest serialization options (normalizes the JSON).
5. Creates a `WorkQueue` entry with the train name, serialized input, input type name, priority, and `scheduledAt` converted to UTC.
6. Stamps the entry's subject key from the train's [`QueueSubjectKey`](/docs/core/trains-and-junctions#queuesubjectkey-serializing-work-that-touches-the-same-thing) override, if it has one. An exception from `QueueSubjectKey`, or an empty or over-long key, aborts the enqueue, so no entry is written.
7. Tracks the entry, then (if the train overrides [`OnQueue`](/docs/core/trains-and-junctions#onqueue-enqueue-time-hook)) enters the enqueue context and invokes the hook with the entry's `ExternalId` and the input, then saves and commits, all in one transaction. A throw rolls the whole thing back, so nothing the hook tracked on `IEnqueueContextAccessor.Current` survives either. Trains that do not override the hook are never resolved here, enter no context, and open no transaction: their enqueue is a single write.
8. Returns the entry's ID and external ID.

Tracking the entry before the hook runs does not insert it (`Track` is change tracking only), so the hook still runs before the row exists, as its contract states.

When the train sets [`DeferQueuePromotion`](/docs/core/trains-and-junctions#making-the-side-effect-durable), the shape changes to three steps instead: the entry is committed **unconfirmed** and undispatchable, the hook runs outside that transaction, and a second commit promotes it. A throwing hook removes the staged entry if it is still staged, so the observable contract is the same. Once the hook has returned the mutation counts as accepted, so the promotion runs even if the caller cancels. If the entry was cancelled while the hook ran, the promotion finds nothing to confirm and `QueueAsync` throws `InvalidOperationException` instead of reporting success. `IEnqueueContextAccessor.Current` is null inside such a hook, because the entry is already committed and there is no transaction to join. A crash between the two commits leaves the entry unconfirmed, and the scheduler's [stale staged entry sweep](/docs/scheduler/admin-trains/manifest-manager#resolvestalestagedentriesjunction) cancels it (or promotes it, if the host opted in) once it is older than `StaleStagedEntryTimeout`. The sweep runs in the ManifestManager, so it does not run while the ManifestManager is disabled (`SchedulerConfiguration.ManifestManagerEnabled = false`, also the dashboard's Server Settings switch); some host sharing the database must run it.

Providers without transaction support (the in-memory provider) degrade to a single `SaveChanges` with no explicit transaction.

## RunAsync

Executes a train synchronously via `ITrainBus`. This is a blocking call that returns when the train completes. It creates no work queue entry, so it does not fire `OnQueue` and does not consult `QueueSubjectKey`: a synchronous run can overlap queued work for the same subject.

```csharp
Task<RunTrainResult> RunAsync(
    string trainName,
    string inputJson,
    CancellationToken ct = default
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `trainName` | `string` | Yes | N/A | Train name (matched by canonical name, then friendly name) |
| `inputJson` | `string` | Yes | N/A | JSON-serialized input matching the train's `InputType` |
| `ct` | `CancellationToken` | No | `default` | Cancellation token forwarded to `ITrainBus.RunAsync` |

**Returns**: `RunTrainResult`

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `MetadataId` | `long` | Database ID of the metadata record for this execution |
| `Output` | `object?` | The train's typed output. `null` for `Unit` trains; the actual output object for trains with a typed `TOut` parameter. |

**Throws**:
- `TrainNotFoundException` (an `InvalidOperationException`) if no train is registered with the given name, or `AmbiguousTrainNameException` if the name matches more than one train's friendly name.
- `TrainInputValidationException` if `inputJson` exceeds the configured size cap.
- `JsonException` if `inputJson` is the JSON literal `null`, which is well-formed but is not an input.
- `TrainException` if the train itself fails during execution (propagated from `ITrainBus`).
- `TrainAuthorizationException` if the train has `[TraxAuthorize]` requirements the caller does not meet.
- `InvalidOperationException` if the train declares `[TraxAuthorize]` and no `ITrainAuthorizationService` is registered, unless the host called `AllowMissingAuthorizationService()`. The same fail-closed rule as `QueueAsync`.

### What it does

1. Looks up the train by `trainName` via `ITrainDiscoveryService`.
2. Authorizes the caller against the train's requirements, failing closed as described under **Throws**.
3. Deserializes `inputJson` to the train's `InputType`.
4. Creates a `Metadata` record with a generated external ID.
5. Persists the metadata via the data context.
6. Calls the typed `ITrainBus.RunAsync<TOut>(input, ct, metadata)` via reflection, using the train's `OutputType` from its registration.
7. Returns the metadata ID and the train's output (or `null` for `Unit` trains).

## Examples

### Queue a train for async dispatch

```csharp
public class OrderController(ITrainExecutionService execution) : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost("orders/queue")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> QueueOrder(
        [FromBody] JsonElement input,
        CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var result = await execution.QueueAsync(
            "MyApp.Trains.IProcessOrderTrain",
            input.GetRawText(),
            priority: 5,
            ct);

        return Accepted(new { result.WorkQueueId, result.ExternalId });
    }
}
```

### Run a train synchronously

```csharp
public class OrderController(ITrainExecutionService execution) : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost("orders/run")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> RunOrder(
        [FromBody] JsonElement input,
        CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var result = await execution.RunAsync(
            "MyApp.Trains.IProcessOrderTrain",
            input.GetRawText(),
            ct);

        return Ok(new { result.MetadataId });
    }
}
```

### Discover available trains first

```csharp
public class TrainController(
    ITrainDiscoveryService discovery,
    ITrainExecutionService execution
) : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost("trains/{trainName}/run")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> RunByName(
        string trainName,
        [FromBody] JsonElement input,
        CancellationToken ct)
    {
        // Validate the train exists before attempting execution
        var trains = discovery.DiscoverTrains();
        var match = trains.FirstOrDefault(t => t.ServiceType.FullName == trainName);

        if (match is null)
            return NotFound($"No train registered with name '{trainName}'");

        var result = await execution.RunAsync(trainName, input.GetRawText(), ct);
        return Ok(new { result.MetadataId });
    }
}
```

## Concurrency Limiting

`RunAsync` supports per-train and global concurrency limits to prevent overloading remote backends. When a limit is reached, additional requests wait in-process until a slot opens. No requests are rejected.

See [Concurrency Limiting](/docs/sdk-reference/mediator-api/concurrency-limiting) for configuration details.

## Package

```
dotnet add package Trax.Mediator
