# Runtime integrity checks

The [differential](/docs/statemachine#two-runtimes-one-behavior) and drift tests prove the C# machine and the
generated TypeScript twin agree at **build time**, from one commit. At **runtime** the two engines run in
different processes at possibly different versions: the twin is baked into whatever client bundle the user
loaded (which may be days old), the C# machine is the deployed server. These three checks catch the divergence
that build-time tests structurally cannot: client/server version skew in production.

All three are opt-in from the client side: a client that sends nothing is unaffected, so they roll out
gradually as clients start sending the new fields.

## Schema-hash handshake

Every machine exposes a stable content hash of its behaviour:

| Member | Where | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IMachine.SchemaHash` | C# server | lowercase-hex SHA-256 of `ExportIr()`; `null` for a raw-delegate machine (no exportable IR, so no twin and no handshake) |
| `TypedMachine.schemaHash` / the twin's `irHash` | TypeScript client | SHA-256 of the same committed IR, embedded in the generated twin |

Both hash the committed IR, so they are equal by construction (the drift tests pin `ExportIr()` to the
committed `ir.json`, and the twin hashes that same file with its trailing newline stripped to match `ExportIr()`).

The client sends its `schemaHash` on each snapshot mutation (`saveSnapshot`, `advanceSnapshot`, `loadSnapshot`,
`sendSnapshot`). When it differs from the server's registered machine, the request is refused with a
[`schema-mismatch`](/docs/sdk-reference/statemachine-api/result-codes) problem, so a stale client reloads
instead of writing under an outdated contract. A client that sends no hash is not checked.

```csharp
// The registered machine's hash, for the handshake.
string? hash = registry.SchemaHash("checkout");
```

A machine with no exportable IR returns `null`, and the guard treats null as "no check" rather than throwing.
The hash is computed once, on first read, and every concurrent reader waits for that value: a request that
arrives while the first one is still building the machine gets the hash, never a `null` that would switch the
check off.

## Divergence detection

The schema hash catches a version mismatch; this catches a genuine behavioural disagreement on a *real* input.
On `advanceSnapshot`, the client may send `clientResult`, the snapshot its twin computed for the advance, as
canonical wire. The server re-drives the advance authoritatively and compares before it writes anything:

```
client twin: (pre-state, trigger, input) -> clientResult
server C#:   (pre-state, trigger, input) -> serverResult   <- authoritative
```

If the two canonical wires differ, the advance is refused with a
[`client-divergence`](/docs/sdk-reference/statemachine-api/result-codes) problem and the client reloads. The
refusal is real: the stored draft is exactly as it was before the request, so the reload shows the pre-state
and a retry fires the trigger once. A client that sends no `clientResult` is not checked.

The comparison lives in `ISnapshotDraftService.Advance(userKey, id, trigger, input, requestId, clientResult)`,
which computes the advance, checks it, and only then writes. A custom `ISnapshotDraftService` that does not
override that overload throws `NotSupportedException` when handed a client result, rather than persisting an
advance it would then report as refused.

Because the server drives from the stored snapshot and, under optimistic concurrency, the client's pre-state
equals the last server snapshot, a post-state mismatch is a real divergence signal: a skew the schema hash
missed, or a bug.

## Startup self-check

The same committed [differential corpus](/docs/statemachine#two-runtimes-one-behavior) the CI test replays can
be replayed by the running server, proving the deployed C# engine still reproduces the machine's behaviour.

| Member | Returns | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IMachine.Corpus` | `string?` | the machine's committed golden corpus, or null if it ships none |
| `IMachine.SelfCheck()` | `IReadOnlyList<string>` | replays `Corpus` through the machine's own engine; one diff per case it fails to reproduce (empty == agreement, and empty when there is no corpus) |
| `SnapshotSelfCheck.Run(machines)` | `IReadOnlyList<string>` | runs every machine's self-check and aggregates the diffs, machine-prefixed |
| `IHealthChecksBuilder.AddTraxStateMachineSelfCheck(string name = "state-machines")` | `IHealthChecksBuilder` | registers `SnapshotSelfCheck.Run` over every discovered machine as an ASP.NET Core health check |

Register it as a health check with `AddTraxStateMachineSelfCheck`, which `Trax.Effect.StateMachine.Persistence`
ships. It resolves every `IMachine` that `AddStateMachines` discovered, so it needs no configuration and picks
up a new machine on its own:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHealthChecks().AddTraxStateMachineSelfCheck();   // check name defaults to "state-machines"
```

The check is Healthy when every machine reproduces its corpus, and Unhealthy with every diff in its
description otherwise. It replays each corpus in full on every call and does not observe the health-check
cancellation token, so poll it at a modest interval. Nothing runs it until you register it, and registering
it does not gate startup: map it to an endpoint and poll it, or call `SnapshotSelfCheck.Run(machines)` from
your own startup code if a drifted engine should stop the host from starting.

A machine ships its corpus by overriding `Corpus` (e.g. from an embedded resource); a machine that ships none
is skipped, not failed.

## Result codes

| Code | Returned by | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema-mismatch` | save, advance, load, send | the client's `schemaHash` differs from the server's machine; reload |
| `client-divergence` | advance | the client's `clientResult` differs from the server's authoritative result; nothing was written, reload |

Both surface on the mutation's `problem` field like every other [result code](/docs/sdk-reference/statemachine-api/result-codes).
