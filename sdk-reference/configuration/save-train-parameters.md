# SaveTrainParameters

Serializes train input and output parameters to JSON and stores them in the `Metadata.Input` and `Metadata.Output` fields. Enables parameter inspection in the dashboard and database.

## Signature

```csharp
public static TBuilder SaveTrainParameters<TBuilder>(
    this TBuilder effectBuilder,
    JsonSerializerOptions? jsonSerializerOptions = null,
    Action<ParameterEffectConfiguration>? configure = null
)
    where TBuilder : TraxEffectBuilder
```

The generic type parameter `TBuilder` is inferred by the compiler, so callers just write `.SaveTrainParameters()`. This preserves the concrete builder type through chaining (e.g., `TraxEffectBuilderWithData` stays as `TraxEffectBuilderWithData`).

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `jsonSerializerOptions` | `JsonSerializerOptions?` | No | `TraxJsonSerializationOptions.Default` | Custom System.Text.Json options for parameter serialization |
| `configure` | `Action<ParameterEffectConfiguration>?` | No | `null` | Optional callback to configure which parameters are serialized |

### ParameterEffectConfiguration

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `SaveInputs` | `bool` | `true` | Whether to serialize train input parameters to `Metadata.Input` |
| `SaveOutputs` | `bool` | `true` | Whether to serialize train output parameters to `Metadata.Output` |
| `MaxParameterBytes` | `int?` | `null` | Hard byte ceiling per serialized parameter (input and output). `null` is unbounded. A payload that serializes past this many UTF-8 bytes is aborted mid-serialization and stored as `{"_truncated": true, "_maxBytes": N}` instead. Must be positive. |
| `ShouldSaveInputs` | `Func<string, bool>?` | `null` | Predicate receiving the canonical train name (`Metadata.Name`); return `false` to skip serializing that train's input. Also the way to express an opt-in, which a list of exclusions cannot. |
| `ShouldSaveOutputs` | `Func<string, bool>?` | `null` | Predicate receiving the canonical train name (`Metadata.Name`); return `false` to skip serializing that train's output. The escape hatch for cases the `ExcludeOutput` helpers can't express. |

The configuration is registered as a singleton and can also be modified at runtime via the dashboard's Effects page.

#### Per-train opt-out helpers

For the common case (a known set of trains), use the `ExcludeInput` and `ExcludeOutput` helpers instead of a predicate. Each skips serialization for trains whose canonical name contains the given fragment, and returns the configuration for chaining.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ExcludeInput(string fragment)` | Skip input for trains whose `Metadata.Name` contains `fragment`. |
| `ExcludeInput(Type type)` | Skip input for trains whose name contains `type.FullName`. |
| `ExcludeInput<TTrain>()` | Same as the `Type` overload, using `typeof(TTrain)`. |
| `ExcludeOutput(string fragment)` | Skip output for trains whose `Metadata.Name` contains `fragment`. |
| `ExcludeOutput(Type type)` | Skip output for trains whose name contains `type.FullName`. |
| `ExcludeOutput<TTrain>()` | Same as the `Type` overload, using `typeof(TTrain)`. |

The two sides are independent: excluding a train's input leaves its output alone, and the reverse.

Matching is a substring check against the canonical name, so pass the type that appears in that name: the train interface for named routes, or the request/query type for trains dispatched by input type (e.g. via the MediatR bridge, where `Metadata.Name` is the assembly-qualified request type). `MaxParameterBytes` is the automatic safety net for the trains you did not predict; the exclusion lists are the explicit knob for the ones you did.

#### Saving only some trains' inputs

Exclusions answer "everything except these". When the list worth keeping is the short one, use the predicate instead:

```csharp
cfg.ShouldSaveInputs = name => name.Contains(typeof(IPatchCustomerTrain).FullName!);
```

That serializes the mutation train's input and nothing else, which is the usual shape when inputs carry personal data and only the replayable ones are worth storing. Pair it with [per-train metadata retention](/docs/sdk-reference/scheduler-api/add-metadata-cleanup) to decide how long each of them is kept.

#### Masking sensitive fields

Excluding a train drops its whole input or output. To keep the record but hide one field, mark the member with `[TraxSensitive]` (namespace `Trax.Effect.Attributes`):

```csharp
public record ChargeCustomerInput(
    string CustomerId,
    [TraxSensitive] string CardNumber,
    Address BillingAddress
);

public class Address
{
    public string City { get; set; } = "";

    [TraxSensitive]
    public string Street { get; set; } = "";
}
```

The stored input then reads `{"customerId": "c-1", "cardNumber": {"_redacted": true}, "billingAddress": {"city": "Leeds", "street": {"_redacted": true}}}`. The train runs with the real values; only the stored copy is masked.

| Case | What happens |
|------|--------------|
| A marked member on a nested object, or on each element of a collection | Masked where it sits; the rest of the object is kept |
| A marked member whose value is an object or a collection | The whole value is replaced; nothing under it is written |
| A positional record parameter | Mark the parameter, with or without `property:` |
| `[JsonPropertyName]` on the member | Masked under its JSON name |
| A mark on a base property or an interface member | Applies to the override or implementation |
| A dictionary's keys or values | Not masked: there is no member to mark |
| A member named `Password` with no mark | Not masked. Nothing is masked by name |

The same masking applies to the junction output recorded by `AddJunctionLogger(serializeJunctionData: true)`, and to the output handed to lifecycle hooks when `SaveTrainParameters` is off, so a broadcast or subscription never carries the value either. It does **not** apply to the copy a train is run from: a queued entry's input and a manifest's properties keep the real value, because the train needs it. Those copies are kept out of logs instead: a model's `ToString()`, the JSON effect and the junction logger write each as `{"_omitted": true}` (`TraxLogSerialization.ForLogging(options)` derives the options they use). A masked input cannot be deserialized back into the input type; `TraxRedaction.ContainsRedaction(json)` says whether a stored input or output holds a mask. Why it is opt-in and masked where it is written is recorded in `effect/0010`.

## Returns

`TBuilder`, the same builder type that was passed in, for continued fluent chaining.

## Examples

Basic usage (saves both inputs and outputs):

```csharp
services.AddTrax(trax => trax
    .AddEffects(effects => effects
        .UsePostgres(connectionString)
        .SaveTrainParameters()
    )
);
```

Save only inputs (skip output serialization):

```csharp
services.AddTrax(trax => trax
    .AddEffects(effects => effects
        .UsePostgres(connectionString)
        .SaveTrainParameters(configure: cfg =>
        {
            cfg.SaveInputs = true;
            cfg.SaveOutputs = false;
        })
    )
);
```

Custom JSON options with configuration:

```csharp
services.AddTrax(trax => trax
    .AddEffects(effects => effects
        .UsePostgres(connectionString)
        .SaveTrainParameters(
            jsonSerializerOptions: new JsonSerializerOptions { WriteIndented = false },
            configure: cfg => cfg.SaveOutputs = false
        )
    )
);
```

Keep inputs, drop the output of a few known-large trains, and cap everything else:

```csharp
services.AddTrax(trax => trax
    .AddEffects(effects => effects
        .UsePostgres(connectionString)
        .SaveTrainParameters(configure: cfg =>
        {
            cfg.MaxParameterBytes = 1_048_576;   // 1 MB ceiling for every parameter
            cfg.ExcludeOutput<GetEntitiesQuery>();
            cfg.ExcludeOutput<GetLeadsQuery>();
            cfg.ExcludeOutput("GetPpaDataFromCache");   // string fragments work too
        })
    )
);
```

A train whose output crosses `MaxParameterBytes` stores `{"_truncated": true, "_maxBytes": 1048576}` in `Metadata.Output` instead of the full payload. A train matched by `ExcludeOutput` stores nothing for its output, and its input is still serialized unless `ExcludeInput` or `ShouldSaveInputs` also refuses it.

A parameter `System.Text.Json` cannot represent at all, a reference cycle or an unsupported type, stores `{"_unserializable": true, "_error": "JsonException"}` on the same principle. Only the exception's type is kept: the messages carry unbounded detail, which is the wrong thing to put in the column a ceiling exists to bound. The run itself is unaffected, because an output that cannot be stored is a recording problem rather than a reason to fail work that already succeeded.

## Remarks

- Requires a data provider to be registered (the serialized parameters are stored in the database via `Metadata`).
- The serialized JSON is stored in `Metadata.Input` (set on train start) and `Metadata.Output` (set on completion).
- Useful for debugging failed trains: inspect the exact input that caused the failure.
- The `ParameterEffectConfiguration` singleton is accessible at runtime. The dashboard's Effects page provides a UI to toggle `SaveInputs` and `SaveOutputs` without restarting the application. The per-train exclusions and predicates are set in code and are not editable there; the global toggles are the outer gate, so turning `SaveInputs` off from the dashboard stops every train's input regardless of what the predicate says.
- **Lifecycle hooks receive the output under the same rules as the stored copy.** When the output is stored, `OnCompleted` hooks read that copy, bounded by `MaxParameterBytes`. When it is not, the train serializes a copy for the hooks in memory, without persisting it, and follows the same decision: an output skipped by `ExcludeOutput`, `ShouldSaveOutputs` or `SaveOutputs = false` is not serialized for the hooks either, and they see `Metadata.Output` as `null`. Any copy that is built is bounded: by `MaxParameterBytes` when it is set, and otherwise by 1 MiB (`DefaultLifecycleHookOutputPolicy.DefaultMaxCopyBytes`), past which the hooks get the `_truncated` placeholder. The same 1 MiB ceiling applies on a host without `SaveTrainParameters()`, and when the effect is switched off from the dashboard. This matters because the broadcaster, GraphQL and SignalR hooks publish the copy to other processes and every subscriber.
- **`MaxParameterBytes` bounds serialization work, not the result object.** It serializes through a streaming writer and aborts the moment the byte count crosses the ceiling, so an oversized collection or object graph is never fully materialized as a string. It does not shrink the train's return value itself, which is already resident in memory. For a train that genuinely returns tens of MB, prefer `ExcludeOutput` (skip serialization entirely) and reduce what the train returns.
